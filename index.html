        <h3>What is code?</h3>
        <h3>Coding is the process of transforming computer instructions into a form a computer can understand.</h3>
        <h3>Every website and app operates because programmers write code.</h3>
        <h3>However, you do not have to work in technology to use coding.</h3>
        <h3>In fact, job hunters can find most coding jobs outside of the tech industry.</h3>

        <h3>Who is the person the made <strong>HTML</strong></h3>
        <h3>Development In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents.</h3>
        <h3> In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.</h3>
        <h3>Berners-Lee was born on 8 June 1955 in London, England, the eldest of the four children of Mary Lee Woods and Conway Berners-Lee; his brother Mike is a professor of ecology and climate change management.</h3>
        <h3>Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee OM KBE FRS FREng FRSA DFBCS RDI (born 8 June 1955),[1] also known as TimBL, is an English computer scientist best known as the inventor of the World Wide Web, the HTML markup language, the URL system, and HTTP.</h3>

        <h3>What was HTML like before</h3>
        <h3>Before the World Wide Web the Internet really only provided screens full of text (and usually only in one font and font size).</h3>
        <h3>So although it was pretty good for exchanging information, and indeed for accessing information such as the Catalogue of the US Library of Congress, it was visually very boring.</h3>
        <h3>In an attempt to make this more aesthetic, companies like Compuserve and AOL began developing what used to be called GUIs (or graphical user interfaces).</h3>
        <h3>GUIs added a bit of colour and a bit of layout, but were still pretty boring.</h3>
